# Muse

Muse reinvents how everyone burn their calories -- by playing musical instrument, instead of exercising.

Muse uses a combination between iOS and WatchOS applications; to help you burn calories, while listening and covering to your favorite musics.

You and others may compete on how many calories burned to a particular song, within a specified playback speed.

## Tech Stacks and Platforms

Muse uses a combination of WatchKit, HealthKit, AVFoundation, SwiftData, and Firebase to both iOS and WatchOS, to ensure pleasant experience for the new way of "working out".
